<h3> December 18, 2024 – NEW YORK CITY </h3>
<p>
	"We’re asking for equity," New York City Councilman Rafael Salamanca said via X in October. His statement was in reference to the number of shelters he says are in his City Council District, 60, an unfair number compared with other districts which have none.
</p>
<p>
	Shelters have long been a contentious topic in New York City, especially within the past two years as migrants and asylum seekers from the U.S.-Mexico border have been bussed to the city. New York City has what is known as a  <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/investigations/migrant-crisis/nyc-right-to-shelter-rule-settled/5228845/"> "right to shelter"</a> law. The specifics of the statue have changed over the last year, as the shelter systems became overwhelmed with demand from asylum seekers. Instead of the previous general guarantee to shelter, this law's past guidance, young adults can only remain in the city-run shelter system for 60 days. Some adult migrants are only able to stay for 30 days.

<p>
	Earlier this month, New York City Mayor Eric Adams <a href="https://nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/912-24/mayor-adams-additional-shelter-closures-including-floyd-bennett-field-migrant"> announced</a> that his office would be closing a total of 25 migrant shelters within the coming months. Additional migrant shelters outside of the city will also be closing by March 2025, according to the Mayor's press release.

	The below map shows which New York City Community districts – which are different from both Community Board districts and City Council districts, but often overlap with those borders – have the most shelters per 100k residents. The population data used for the map comes from the 2020 U.S. Census and the shelter data is a total of the number of shelters in each community district, regardless of type, as of October 31, 2024. Given Councilman Salamanca's recent statement and the news about shelter closures, the map indicates which neighborhoods have been bearing the brunt of the responsilibity of sheltering houseless residents. Hovering over the community districts also makes visible the number of shelters in each district.

	The graphic demonstrates that some community districts have as few as zero shelters – such areas of the city include the southernmost area of Staten Island, Bay Ridge and Bath Beach in Brooklyn, and Pelham Parkway in the Bronx. But just southwest of the Pelham neighborhoods in Tremont, the community district has 30 shelters per 100k residents. However, as the data on the map indicates, that community district does not have the highest number of shelters. A community district in southeast Queens, containing Hollis and Jamaica, has 38 total shelters.
